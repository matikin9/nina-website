    <h2>Currently: LA Metro (LACMTA)</h2>
    
    I work as the Tech Lead on the Digital Services team at LA Metro.
    
    <h2>Previously: LA County Auditor-Controller</h2>
    
    <p>I worked as a Systems Analyst at the LA County Auditor-Controller from 2007 to 2020.  I was a member of a small team, taking on web development, business analysis, and project management work for internal systems used at the County.</p>

    <h2>What I do</h2>
    
    I started off my career as a coder, and while I still occasionally monkey around in code my focus these days is primarily on institutional change to improve government services.  What I advocate for in my government work:
    
    <ul>
      <li>open source code and modern tools</li>
      <li>open data and data standardization</li>
      <li>cross-department/agency collaboration; breaking down silos</li>
      <li>user-centered design</li>
      <li>rapid prototyping and incremental development</li>
      <li>improving procurement processes</li>
      <li>improving hiring and retention</li>
    </ul>
