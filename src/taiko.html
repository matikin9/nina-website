    A brand new community center, the Terasaki Budokan, opened in Little Tokyo during the pandemic. In Fall 2021, they started hosting taiko classes. I've always wanted to learn percussion and I've always loved taiko so I signed up immediately! It was challenging but also immensely fun.

    We are the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jtowntaikoclub/" target="_blank">JTown Taiko Club</a> and we're raising $40,000 for a brand new set of drums so that taiko will be a permanent program at the Budokan.

  <p>If you're able to donate to the cause, I'd love to show you my appreciation by gifting you a handmade doily!</p>

  <p>You can donate through <a href="https://give.ltsc.org/give/288022/#!/donation/checkout" target="_blank">the website</a>, but you'll need to <strong>include a note that your donation is for the JTown Taiko Club</strong>. You could also Venmo me (@nina-kin) or send me a check and I will hand deliver your donation as cash to the Budokan.</p>

  <p>Send me a screenshot of your donation and let me know which doily you'd like! The large doilies are one and done so if there's one that catches your eye you'll need to claim it quick.</p>
