    The Terasaki Budokan, a brand new community center, opened in Little Tokyo during the pandemic. In Fall 2021, they created the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jtowntaikoclub/" target="_blank">JTown Taiko Club</a> started hosting taiko classes. I've always been a fan of taiko so I signed up immediately! While I grew up playing music, this was my first time playing percussion so it was challenging but also turned out to be really fun.

    We had our 1-year anniversary a few months ago and we officially kicked off our fundraising campaign to get a brand new set of drums for the club. The drums we've been using were kindly loaned to the group by our instructors, <a href="http://elataiko.com/" target="_blank">Maceo Hernandez</a> and <a href="https://www.walternishinaka.com/" target="_blank">Walter Nishinaka</a>. But to really grow the group and establish taiko as a permanent program at the Budokan, we'll need to raise $40,000 for a brand new set of drums.

    Any little bit helps and if you're able to donate, I'd love to show my appreciation by gifting you a handmade doily!
  </p>

  <p>
    You can donate through <a href="https://give.ltsc.org/give/288022/#!/donation/checkout" target="_blank">the website</a>, but you'll need to <strong>include a note that your donation is for the JTown Taiko Club</strong>. You could also Venmo me (@nina-kin) or send me a check and I will hand deliver your donation as cash to the Budokan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Send me a screenshot of your donation and let me know which doily you'd like! The large doilies are one and done so if there's one that catches your eye you'll need to claim it quick.
