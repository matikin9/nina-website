    The Terasaki Budokan, a brand new community center, opened in Little Tokyo during the pandemic. In Fall 2021, they created the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jtowntaikoclub/" target="_blank">JTown Taiko Club</a> started hosting taiko classes. I've always been a fan of taiko so I signed up immediately! While I grew up playing music, this was my first time playing percussion so it was challenging but also turned out to be really fun.

    We had our 1-year anniversary a few months ago and we officially kicked off our fundraising campaign to get a brand new set of drums for the club. The drums we've been using were kindly loaned to the group by our instructors, <a href="http://elataiko.com/" target="_blank">Maceo Hernandez</a> and <a href="https://www.walternishinaka.com/" target="_blank">Walter Nishinaka</a>. But to really grow the group and establish taiko as a permanent program at the Budokan, we'll need to raise $40,000 for a brand new set of drums.

    Any little bit helps and if you're able to donate, I'd love to show my appreciation by gifting you a doily handmade by me! There's a variety of sizes and styles split into tiers. If you're able to donate $100+, please choose from the large doilies (8"-12" diameter) below and let me know so I can reserve the doily for you. Once I confirm the doily is still available, just send me a photo or screenshot of your donation. The large ones take several weeks to crochet so once they're gone, they're gone! ðŸ˜†
